# Project hapax

## Questions:

How many Turing universal graph rewrite systems are? 

Can we build custom, private computing systems, which are ἄπαξ χέων, which means "poured only once"?

## Goal of hapax

We in a unitary way a large family of asynchronous graph rewriting automata, by encoding a graph rewrite as a permutation of the ends of the edges of a graph. A local rewrite, i.e. one which involves a small number of nodes and edges, is then encoded as a small permutation. 

By varying the permutation we can vary the graph rewrite. As an example, there are 14400 variants of the iconic beta rewrite:
